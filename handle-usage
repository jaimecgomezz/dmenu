usage: handle ACTION PATCH [OPTIONS]

A truly modular implementation of dmenu

Options:
  -q                  Quiet, prevents compiler output

Actions:
  patch               Apply the PATCH and rebuild
  depatch             Removes the PATCH and rebuild
  diff                Apply the PATCH while keeping the current build, useful for debugging
  stash               Removes the PATCH while keeping the current build, useful for debugging

Patches:
  border              Allows borders in the dmenu window
  case-insensitive    Makes dmenu case insensitive
  center              Makes dmenu appear centered on the screen
  dynamic-options     Makes dmenu run the command given to it whenever input is changed with the current input as the last argument and update the option list according to the output of that command
  fuzzymatch          Allows the users to type non-consecutive portions of the string to be matched
  fuzzyhighlight      This patch make it so that fuzzy matches gets highlighted and is therefore meant to be used together with the patch fuzzymatch
  grid                Allows you to render dmenu's entries in a grid. Not compatible with the dynamic-options patch.
